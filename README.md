Hii, I'm Priscylla, I'm Brazilian and I was born in 2007. I'm currently a student at IFRN - Campus Caicó in the area of ​​Internet Computing.
Here I intend to share my codes that I decide to create.
I am fluent in Portuguese, my native language, and Spanish. I like Latin Urban Music and a lot of Rock N' Rock (Linkin Park forevarrr)
